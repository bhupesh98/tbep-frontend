### Step 1: Uploading the network file

You can upload your own network file, which contains the gene-gene interaction information, either in CSV format or in JSON format. An example is showing at the bottom of the above picture.

### Step 2: Clicking "Submit" Button

After click "Submit", our tool will lead you to the [network visualization page](../network-visualization.mdx).
